                <p> A Full-Stack developer is a professional responsible for working on both front-end and back-end
                    development processes. They design, develop, and maintain fully-fledged and functioning platforms
                    with
                    databases or servers. These servers do not need other third-party applications to build an entire
                    system
                    from scratch.</p>

                <p> Are you a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a
                    few
                    months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully
                    come
                    to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser.
